Hello! I'm Augusto. I live in Encarnación, Paraguay. I'm from Argentina but my friends call me Chile. 

It was fun reading what i wrote 3 years ago (below text here). 

After meeting lots of people, getting involved in stuff, and getting my toes wet, I can confidently say i've now coded a couple off apps

ive automated some small tasks, i can control most modern technological tools I'm aware of. The Augusto that couldn't code is gone now apparently

rn im feeling pretty good abt this, hopefully, im gonna contribute something in the near future. this is mainly to boost my linkedin profile.

# Hello, I'm Augusto

I couldn't write a single line of code even if my life depended on it.

I have a passion for cars, computers, and exploring business ventures. Currently, I'm getting into electromechanics.

## Collaboration Interests 💼

I'm open to collaborating and offering my skills in:
